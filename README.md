## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Supabase Configuration

1. Create a new Supabase project at [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Configure environment variables:
   ```bash
   # API Package (.env)
   PORT=3001
   SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your-service-role-key

   # Web Package (.env)
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
   ```

3. Install Supabase CLI:
   ```bash
   brew install supabase/tap/supabase
   ```

4. Link to your Supabase project:
   ```bash
   # Get your access token from: https://supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens
   export SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-access-token
   
   # Link to your project
   supabase link --project-ref your-project-ref
   
   # Push database migrations
   supabase db push
   ```

### Database Schema

The project uses the following tables:

- **keys**: Stores environment variables and API keys
  - `id`: UUID (Primary Key)
  - `name`: Text (Required)

  - `tags`: Text Array
  - `revoked`: Boolean
  - `user_id`: UUID (Foreign Key to auth.users)
  - `created_at`, `updated_at`: Timestamps

- **solutions**: Groups of related keys
  - `id`: UUID (Primary Key)
  - `name`: Text (Required)
  - `description`: Text
  - `user_id`: UUID (Foreign Key to auth.users)
  - `created_at`, `updated_at`: Timestamps

- **solution_keys**: Many-to-many relationship between solutions and keys
  - `solution_id`: UUID (Foreign Key to solutions)
  - `key_id`: UUID (Foreign Key to keys)

### Security Features

- Row Level Security (RLS) policies ensure users can only access their own data
- Automatic timestamps for auditing
- Service role key for admin operations
- Anonymous key for public operations
